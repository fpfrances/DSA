# üß† Data Structures & Algorithms in JavaScript

Welcome to my personal collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations in JavaScript. This repository serves as a learning resource and a showcase of various fundamental concepts in computer science.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository includes implementations of:

- **Data Structures**:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Hash Tables
  - Trees (Binary Search Trees, DFS, BFS)
  - Graphs (Adjacency List)

- **Algorithms**:
  - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort)
  - Recursion Techniques
  - String Manipulations (e.g., Palindrome checks, String reversal)
  - Utility Functions (e.g., Factorial, FizzBuzz, Array Chunking)

Each file is self-contained and focuses on a specific concept or problem.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore and run the code:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fpfrances/DSA.git
